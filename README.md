A minimal game built in S&box that focuses on testing the various features inside S&box and testing, using, extending, and developing [SWB](https://github.com/timmybo5/simple-weapon-base).
The gamemode itself is a love letter to the gamemode [Flying Scoutsman in CS:GO](https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_Scoutsman) - My favorite gamemode from CS:GO (please bring it to cs2... i miss it)

##### Built using:
- Our Chat system from [DarkRP](https://github.com/sousou63/DarkRP)
- [SWB](https://github.com/timmybo5/simple-weapon-base)
- Inspiration was taken from [Sandbox Classic by Softsplit](https://sbox.game/softsplit/sandbox) and [Nicked/HC1 by Facepunch](https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-hc1)

##### Features:
- Flying sausage man
- Sniper gun thingy
- Custom main menu - `select map`, `find servers`, and `back to the main menu`
- Chat system
- Health
- Scoreboard

##### Contains examples of:
- Using SWB and extending the HUD that comes with it
  - Adding a player, using a subset of the guns, and adding them to a level.
  - Replacing HUD elements by creating custom classes that inherit from the built-in HUD elements - CustomAmmoDisplay.cs.
  - Changing styling of HUD elements without creating custom classes - HealthDisplay.cs.
- Setting up a custom main menu with the built-in tools
- Using a video as a backdrop for a custom main menu
